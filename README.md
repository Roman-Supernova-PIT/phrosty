# phrosty

**PHotometry for ROman Simulations protoTYpe.**

Aldoroty, L.,  *et al.*, 2025, in prep

This is lightcurve software being developed for the Roman Supernova Project Infrastructure Team (SNPIT).  It is designed to take a sequence of Roman images, divided into "template" and "science" images.  It subtracts each template image from each science image.  It then measures the flux in a point source at a specified RA/Dec on each difference image.  A combination of all of the fluxes measured for a given science image provide an estimate of the flux at the MJD of that science image.  All of these fluxes together provide the lightcurve.

Currently, *phrosty* only handles the OpenUniverse sims [ref needed].  It reads images from those sims in FITS format, using the standard FITS WCSes found in the headers of those files for image alignment.  The galsim package and a particular version of the roman imsim package (https://github.com/matroxel/roman_imsim.git) provide the PSF used both for PSF photometry and for the PSF matching in the SFFT image subtraction software (Hu *et al.*, 2022, ApJ, 936, 157).

## Preqrequisites and Environment

Although SFFT works in both CPU and GPU environments, currently some of the code in *phrosty* requires a CUDA-based GPU.  It requires a machine with an NVidia GPU that has at least (check this) 30MB of GPU RAM.  The Perlmutter GPU nodes at NERSC meet this requirement, but consumer graphics cards with only 12GB of RAM aren't sufficient.

A number of standard python libraries are required, all of which may be installed from pip, including `numpy`, `scipy`, `astropy`, `scikit-image`, `cupy-cuda12x`, `pandas`, `requests`, `fitsio`, `pyarrow`, `fastparquet`, and (maybe?) `nvmath-python[cu12]`.  *Phrosty* also requires `galsim`, which may be installed from pip.

Phrosty requires commit `74a9053` from `roman_imsim`, which may be git cloned from https://github.com/matroxel/roman_imsim.git.  (This is nominally `v2.0` of that archive, but as of this writing, there is both a branch and a tag `v2.0`, which confuses the `git archive` command.  Thus, we give you the specific commit.)

The fledgling/proposed Roman SNPIT docker environment at https://github.com/Roman-Supernova-PIT/snpit_docker_env provides a Dockerized environment that *phrosty* should be able to run in.  As of this writing, we're using version `v0.0.1` of that environment.

### Manual installs

Not included in the docker image describewd above is SFFTâ€” because, as of this writing, the verison used with phrosty was under development.  SFFT must be separately cloned from git@github.com:Roman-Supernova-PIT/sfft.git, the directory to which you clone that archive must by in your `PTHONPATH`.  As of this writing, *phrosty* requires the `fixes_20241022` branch, though hopefully we will get that branch merged back to the `master` branch.  See "Examples" below for samples of this in action.

### Necessary directories data files

Currently, *phrosty* depends on the following environment variables to find data:

* `SIMS_DIR` : OpenUniverse roman data (on nersc: `/dvs_ro/cfs/cdirs/lsst/shared/external/roman-desc-sims/Roman_data`)
* `SN_INFO_DIR` : A directory that holds information about the OpenUniverse sims, and transients from the OpenUniverse sims.  It must have a file `tds.yaml` that is properly configured for whatever environment you're running.  (Mostly, this means adjusting some absolute diretory paths.)  It must also have a subdirectory for each supernova (named by the supernova's number), which in turn will have ...files... in it.
* `SNANA_PQ_DIR` : A directory with the transient parquet files from the OpenUniverse sims (on nersc: /dvs_ro/cfs/cdirs/lsst/www/DESC_TD_PUBLIC/Roman+DESC/PQ+HDF5_ROMAN+LSST_LARGE)



## Running the code






## Examples

An example running *phrosty* on an interactive node, and on a slurm-allocated node, on Perlmutter at NERSC may be found in the examples/perlmutter directory.



EVERYTHING BELOW STILL NEEDS TO BE EDITED


## Running tests

Tests depend on test data being where it's expected.  It needs to have
the (full?) Roman data from the Roman-DESC / OpenUniverse sims.  Set the
following env vars:

* SIMS_DIR = OpenUniverse roman data  (on nersc: `/global/cfs/cdirs/lsst/shared/external/roman-desc-sims/Roman_data`)
* SNANA_PQ_DIR = ... (on nersc: `/dvs_ro/cfs/cdirs/lsst/www/DESC_TD_PUBLIC/Roman+DESC/PQ+HDF5_ROMAN+LSST_LARGE`)
* SNID_LC_DIR = ... (on nersc: `/dvs_ro/cfs/cdirs/lsst/www/DESC_TD_PUBLIC/Roman+DESC/ROMAN+LSST_LARGE_SNIa-normal`)
* SN_INFO_DIR = must be set to the path of tests/sn_info_dir (contains file tds.yaml)
* DIA_OUT_DIR = a place to write stuff.  Suggest making a directory under tests and pointing at that
* LC_OUT_DIR = a place to write stuff.  Suggest making a directory under tests and pointing at that


## NOTE: If you use this, do a git pull every day. I change this almost daily. 

"phrosty": 

Basic package for working with the Roman-DESC simulations, associated with Aldoroty et al. 2024 in prep. 


Install by cloning this directory, navigating to that directory in your local terminal, and then using
```
pip install -e .
```
## Using the image subtraction module:
Make sure you update the output_files_rootdir variable in imagesubtraction.py, 
as well as rootdir (points to original RomanDESC images) in utils.py. Otherwise, 
you will get path errors.

DEPENDENCIES: 
You need to clone and install this directory:
https://github.com/thomasvrussell/sfft

You also need GalSim, but you can't pip install it at this time because the features
you need are not yet pushed to pip. So, clone and install. 
https://github.com/GalSim-developers/GalSim

Lastly, you need to clone and install the v2.0 branch of roman_imsim.
https://github.com/matroxel/roman_imsim

## Old readme contents:
Currently, you will also need GalSim (clone from git repo), roman_imsim (also clone from git repo), and SFFT (clone from my forked repo **FOR NOW. A pull request on the original repo will be merged soon.)

You will likely need to change the "rootdir" variable in utils.py, and output_files_rootdir in imagesubtraction.py. 

This package is modular. Modules are compatible with each other, and they interface
easily, but you do not need to use all the modules. It contains:
```
sourcedetection.py
objectidentification.py
photometry.py
utils.py
plotaesthetics.py
plotting.py
imagesubtraction.py
```

You'll need:
- Your science image
- The truth file corresponding to that science image
- WCS information 

Photometry usage example:
(THIS IS OLD! PROBABLY DOESN'T WORK!)

hdu = fits.open(imgpath)
wcs = WCS(hdu[1].header)
img = hdu[1].data

objects = detect_sources(img)
# plot_sources(img, objects)

# Note: column names in your truth object table must be distinct from the names of the output columns,
# and the suffix must be '_truth'. e.g. don't put 'x' in your truth object table, put 'x_truth'.
truth_colnames = ['object_id', 'ra_truth', 'dec_truth', 'x_truth', 'y_truth', 'realized_flux', 'flux_truth', 'mag_truth']
truthread = pd.read_csv(truthpath, skipinitialspace=True, names=truth_colnames, sep=' ', comment='#')
cat = Table(Table.from_pandas(truthread), masked=True)

matched_catalog = catalog_matching(objects, cat, wcs)
detected_coords = matched_catalog[matched_catalog['detection'] == 1]

apphot = ap_phot(img, detected_coords)
