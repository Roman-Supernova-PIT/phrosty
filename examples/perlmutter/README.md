# Running phrosty on Perlmutter

Currently, this is primarily for internal development use of members of the Roman SN PIT.  You are welcome to try it if you aren't in the PIT, but at the moment we can't support you.  If you are in the PIT and have trouble with any of this, ping Rob Knop and Lauren Aldoroty in the `#photometry` channel on the Roman SNPIT Slack.

For documentation on running the example in this directory, see [its writeup in the phrosty docs](https://roman-supernova-pit.github.io/phrosty/usage.html#running-on-perlmutter).
